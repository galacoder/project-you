# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure EAS Build for all platforms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up EAS Build configuration for iOS, Android, and web builds with proper environment management and build optimization
### Details:
Implementation Steps:
1. Install and configure EAS CLI: `npm install -g @expo/eas-cli`
2. Initialize EAS in project: `eas build:configure`
3. Configure build profiles in `eas.json`:
   - Development builds for testing
   - Preview builds for staging
   - Production builds for app stores
4. Set up environment variables and secrets
5. Configure platform-specific build settings:
   - iOS: Provisioning profiles, certificates
   - Android: Signing keys, Play Store config
   - Web: Build optimization, hosting config
6. Set up build triggers and automation
7. Test builds on all platforms
8. Configure build caching for faster builds

EAS Configuration:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "production": {
      "channel": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

Files to create/modify:
- `eas.json` - EAS build configuration
- `.easignore` - Files to exclude from builds
- `app.config.ts` - Dynamic app configuration
- Environment-specific configurations

Build Profiles:
- Development: For testing new features
- Preview: For stakeholder review
- Production: For app store submission

Test Strategy:
1. Build Tests: All platforms build successfully
2. Performance Tests: Build times and optimization
3. Distribution Tests: Internal distribution works
4. Environment Tests: Different configs work correctly
5. Store Tests: Production builds meet store requirements

Quality Gates:
- All platform builds complete successfully
- Build times are optimized with caching
- Environment variables properly configured
- Builds meet app store requirements
- Internal distribution works reliably

## 2. Set up EAS Update for over-the-air updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure EAS Update system for delivering JavaScript and asset updates to published apps without app store submission
### Details:
Implementation Steps:
1. Configure EAS Update in `eas.json` and `app.config.ts`
2. Set up update channels for different environments:
   - Development channel for testing
   - Staging channel for preview
   - Production channel for live users
3. Configure update policies and strategies:
   - Automatic updates on app start
   - Background updates
   - Manual update checks
4. Set up update rollback mechanisms
5. Configure update analytics and monitoring
6. Test update delivery and installation
7. Create update deployment scripts
8. Set up CI/CD integration for automated updates

Update Configuration:
```json
{
  "update": {
    "url": "https://u.expo.dev/[project-id]"
  }
}
```

Update Channels:
- development: For testing new features
- staging: For QA and stakeholder review  
- production: For live user updates

Files to modify:
- `eas.json` - Update configuration
- `app.config.ts` - Update URL and settings
- Update deployment scripts
- CI/CD update automation

Update Features:
- Automatic JS/asset updates
- Rollback to previous versions
- Staged rollouts for safety
- Update analytics and monitoring

Test Strategy:
1. Update Tests: Updates install correctly
2. Rollback Tests: Rollback mechanism works
3. Channel Tests: Different channels work independently
4. Performance Tests: Update download and install speed
5. Reliability Tests: Update system handles failures gracefully

Quality Gates:
- Updates deploy successfully to all channels
- Rollback system works reliably
- Update analytics provide useful data
- Update performance meets targets
- Update system handles edge cases properly

## 3. Configure EAS Hosting for web deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up EAS Hosting for web application deployment with proper domain configuration, SSL, and CDN optimization
### Details:
Implementation Steps:
1. Configure web hosting in `eas.json` for web builds
2. Set up custom domain configuration
3. Configure SSL certificates and HTTPS redirect
4. Set up CDN for static asset optimization
5. Configure web-specific build optimizations:
   - Bundle splitting and lazy loading
   - Asset compression and caching
   - SEO optimization and meta tags
6. Set up web analytics and monitoring
7. Configure web deployment automation
8. Test web deployment and performance

Web Hosting Configuration:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "production-web": {
      "platform": "web",
      "output": "static"
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "web": {
        "id": "web-app-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Web Optimization Features:
