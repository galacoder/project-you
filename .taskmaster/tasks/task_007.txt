# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create comprehensive test suite for migration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up complete testing framework covering unit, integration, and E2E tests for all migrated components and features
### Details:
Implementation Steps:
1. Install testing dependencies: Jest, React Native Testing Library, Detox
2. Configure test environments for React Native and Web
3. Create test utilities and helpers
4. Write unit tests for:
   - Zustand store slices and actions
   - React Query hooks and mutations
   - API endpoint handlers
   - Utility functions and helpers
5. Create integration tests for:
   - Component interactions with stores
   - API call flows
   - Navigation flows
6. Set up E2E tests with Detox for critical user journeys
7. Configure test coverage reporting
8. Set up CI/CD test automation

- Accessibility standards validated

## 2. Validate cross-platform functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive testing and validation of all features across iOS, Android, and Web platforms to ensure consistent behavior
### Details:
Implementation Steps:
1. Set up platform-specific testing environments
2. Create cross-platform test matrix covering:
   - Navigation flows on all platforms
   - State management consistency
   - API calls and data sync
   - UI component rendering
   - Performance characteristics
3. Test platform-specific features:
   - iOS: Native navigation, gestures, accessibility
   - Android: Back button, hardware menu, permissions
   - Web: Browser navigation, keyboard shortcuts, responsive design
4. Validate data persistence across platforms
5. Test offline functionality and sync
6. Performance testing on different devices
7. Accessibility testing with platform-specific tools
8. Create platform compatibility documentation

Cross-Platform Test Areas:
